# Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript

We can also multiply one number by another.

JavaScript uses the `*` symbol for multiplication of two numbers.

**Example**
```javascript
const myVar = 13 * 13;
```
`myVar` would have the value `169`.

Change the `0` so that product will equal `80`.

### Instructions: 
1. The variable `product` should be equal to 80.
2. You should use the `*` operator.

## Before Output:
```javascript
const product = 8 * 0;
```

## After Output:
```javascript
const product = 8 * 10;
```
