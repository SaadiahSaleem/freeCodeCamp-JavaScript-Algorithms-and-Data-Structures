# Basic Data Structures

Data can be stored and accessed in many ways. You already know some common JavaScript data structures — arrays and objects.

In this Basic Data Structures course, you'll learn more about the differences between arrays and objects, and which to use in different situations. You'll also learn how to use helpful JS methods like splice() and Object.keys() to access and manipulate data.

# 📂 Basic Data Structures in JavaScript

In this section, I practiced how **data can be stored and accessed in many ways** using JavaScript.  
I already knew some common data structures like **arrays** and **objects**, but here I went deeper into how and when to use them.

---

## 📘 What I Learned
- Differences between **arrays** and **objects**.
- When to choose an array vs. an object.
- How to manipulate arrays and objects effectively.
- Useful built-in methods in JavaScript:
    - `splice()`
    - `slice()`
    - `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, `unshift()`
    - `Object.keys()`
    - `Object.values()`
    - `delete`

## 🛠️ Key Concepts
- **Arrays** → Ordered lists, best for sequential data.
- **Objects** → Key-value pairs, best for structured data.
- Combining both for powerful data manipulation.
- Updating, adding, and removing elements safely.
