# FreeCodeCamp JavaScript - ES6

ECMAScript, or ES, is a standardized version of JavaScript. Because all major browsers follow this specification, the terms ECMAScript and JavaScript are interchangeable.

Most of the JavaScript you've learned up to this point was in ES5 (ECMAScript 5), which was finalized in 2009. While you can still write programs in ES5, JavaScript is constantly evolving, and new features are released every year.

ES6, released in 2015, added many powerful new features to the language. In this course, you'll learn these new features, including arrow functions, destructuring, classes, promises, and modules.

This folder contains my solutions to the **ES6 section** of the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification.

ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced many powerful features that make JavaScript code cleaner, shorter, and easier to read.

## 🛠️ Notes
- **`let` and `const`** replace `var` for safer variable handling.
- **Arrow functions (`=>`)** make function expressions shorter.
- **Template literals** use backticks (\`) for multi-line strings and variable interpolation.
- **Destructuring** allows extracting data from arrays/objects easily.
- **Modules (`export`/`import`)** organize code across files.
