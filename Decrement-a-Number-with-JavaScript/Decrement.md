# Decrement a Number with JavaScript

You can easily *decrement* or decrease a variable by one with the `--` operator.

```javascript
i--;
```
is the equivalent of

```javascript
i = i - 1;
```

**Note:** The entire line becomes `i--;`, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

Change the code to use the `--` operator on `myVar`.

### Instructions:
1. `myVar` should equal `10`.
2. `myVar = myVar - 1`; should be changed.
3. You should not assign `myVar` with `10`.
4. You should use the `--` operator on `myVar`.
5. You should not change code above the specified comment.

## Before Output:
```javascript
let myVar = 11;

// Only change code below this line
myVar = myVar - 1;
```

## After Output:
```javascriptlet myVar = 11;

// Only change code below this line
myVar--;
```
