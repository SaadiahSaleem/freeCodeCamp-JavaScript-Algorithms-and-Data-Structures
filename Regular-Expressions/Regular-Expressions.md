# Regular Expressions

Regular expressions, often shortened to "regex" or "regexp", are patterns that help programmers match, search, and replace text. Regular expressions are very powerful, but can be hard to read because they use special characters to make more complex, flexible matches.

In this course, you'll learn how to use special characters, capture groups, positive and negative lookaheads, and other techniques to match any text you want.

# Regular Expressions (FreeCodeCamp)

This folder contains my solutions for the **Regular Expressions** section of the [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/).

Regular Expressions (regex) are special sequences of characters that help us match, find, and manage text. They are powerful for validating inputs, searching, and replacing strings.

Each task has its own folder/file with:
- The **problem statement** (as a comment or markdown).
- My **solution code**.
- Example console output (if needed).

## ðŸš€ Notes

- Regex in JavaScript uses the `/pattern/flags` syntax.
- Common flags:
    - `g` â†’ global (find all matches)
    - `i` â†’ ignore case
- Useful methods:
    - `.test()` â†’ returns true/false if regex matches.
    - `.match()` â†’ extracts the matched parts of the string.
    - `.replace()` â†’ replaces matched parts.
