# Understand Where an Object’s Prototype Comes From

Just like people inherit genes from their parents, an object inherits its `prototype` directly from the constructor function that created it. For example, here the `Bird` constructor creates the `duck` object:

```javascript
function Bird(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

let duck = new Bird("Donald");
```

`duck` inherits its `prototype` from the `Bird` constructor function. You can show this relationship with the `isPrototypeOf` method:

```javascript
Bird.prototype.isPrototypeOf(duck);
```

This would return `true`.

Use `isPrototypeOf` to check the `prototype` of `beagle`.

### Instructions:
1. You should show that `Dog.prototype` is the `prototype` of `beagle`

## Before Output:
```javascript
function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");

// Only change code below this line
```

## After Output:
```javascript
function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");

// Only change code below this line
Dog.prototype.isPrototypeOf(beagle);
```
