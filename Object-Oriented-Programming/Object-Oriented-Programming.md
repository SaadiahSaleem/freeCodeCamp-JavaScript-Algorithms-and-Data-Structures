# Object Oriented Programming

OOP, or Object Oriented Programming, is one of the major approaches to the software development process. In OOP, objects and classes organize code to describe things and what they can do.

In this course, you'll learn the basic principles of OOP in JavaScript, including the `this` keyword, prototype chains, constructors, and inheritance.

## ‚úÖ Learning Goals

By completing this course and related exercises, I aim to:

- Understand the OOP paradigm in JavaScript
- Write reusable, modular, and maintainable code using classes
- Apply inheritance and polymorphism effectively
- Use encapsulation and abstraction for cleaner design
- Understand how prototypes work under the hood
