# Debugging

**Debugging** is the process of going through your code, finding any issues, and fixing them.

Issues in code generally come in three forms: syntax errors that prevent your program from running, runtime errors where your code has unexpected behavior, or logical errors where your code doesn't do what you intended.

In this course, you'll learn how to use the JavaScript console to debug programs and prevent common issues before they happen.

## 📘 What I Learned
- Different types of errors in JavaScript:
  - **Syntax errors** → prevent code from running.
  - **Runtime errors** → code runs but behaves unexpectedly.
  - **Logical errors** → code runs but doesn’t do what was intended.
- How to use the **JavaScript console** (`console.log`, `console.clear`, etc.) to debug programs.
- Techniques to spot errors before they happen.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts
- **Console methods**:
  - `console.log()` → print variables/values for inspection.
  - `console.clear()` → clear the console output.
  - `console.error()` → highlight errors.
  - `console.table()` → display objects/arrays neatly.
- **Debugging steps**:
  1. Isolate the problem.
  2. Reproduce the issue.
  3. Use console outputs or debugging tools.
  4. Fix and test again.
- Importance of reading **error messages carefully**.
