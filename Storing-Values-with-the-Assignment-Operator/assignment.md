# Storing Values with the Assignment Operator

In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (`=`).

<pre>myVariable = 5;</pre>
This assigns the `Number` value `5` to `myVariable`.

If there are any calculations to the right of the `=` operator, those are performed before the value is assigned to the variable on the left of the operator.

<pre>var myVar;
myVar = 5;</pre>

First, this code creates a variable named `myVar`. Then, the code assigns `5` to `myVar`. Now, if `myVar` appears again in the code, the program will treat it as if it is `5`.

Assign the value `7` to variable `a`.

### Instructions

1. You should not change code above the specified comment.
2. `a` should have a value of 7.

## Before Output:

</pre>

## After Output:
