# Functional Programming

Functional Programming is another popular approach to software development. In Functional Programming, code is organized into smaller, basic functions that can be combined to build complex programs.

In this course, you'll learn the core concepts of Functional Programming including pure functions, how to avoid mutations, and how to write cleaner code with methods like `.map()` and `.filter()`.

Got it! Hereâ€™s a version of the **README.md** specifically designed for the freeCodeCamp Functional Programming course, and formatted for easy copying.

# Functional Programming (freeCodeCamp)

This repository contains examples, exercises, and solutions for the **Functional Programming** course by **freeCodeCamp**. In this course, you'll learn how to apply functional programming concepts using JavaScript.

## Introduction

Functional programming (FP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on using functions to transform data, rather than relying on changing states or mutable variables. This repository provides practical examples and exercises for learning FP concepts in JavaScript, as outlined in freeCodeCamp's **Functional Programming** course.

## Key Concepts

The following key concepts will be covered throughout this course:

- **Pure Functions**: Functions that return the same output for the same input and have no side effects.
- **Immutability**: Data cannot be changed once created.
- **First-Class Functions**: Functions can be passed as arguments, returned as values, and assigned to variables.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that accept other functions as arguments or return them.
- **Recursion**: Functions calling themselves to solve problems instead of using loops.
- **Declarative Programming**: Writing code that specifies *what* should be done, rather than *how* to do it.
- **Lambda Expressions**: Anonymous functions, often used with `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, etc.
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Expressions are evaluated only when they are needed.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into several lessons, which will guide you through understanding and implementing functional programming in JavaScript. The structure follows this general outline:

1. **Introduction to Functional Programming**
2. **Use of Higher-Order Functions**
3. **Working with Arrays in a Functional Way**
4. **Pure Functions and Immutability**
5. **Using Recursion Instead of Loops**
6. **Building More Complex Functional Programs**

## Examples

### Example 1: Pure Function

A simple pure function that adds two numbers:

```javascript
function add(x, y) {
    return x + y;
}

console.log(add(2, 3));  // Output: 5
````

### Example 2: Higher-Order Functions

A higher-order function that takes a function and a value as arguments:

```javascript
function applyFunction(fn, value) {
    return fn(value);
}

const double = (x) => x * 2;
console.log(applyFunction(double, 5));  // Output: 10
```

### Example 3: Using `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`

These higher-order functions allow you to process arrays in a functional style:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Example of `map` (Transforming values)
const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
console.log(doubled);  // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

// Example of `filter` (Filtering values)
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
console.log(evenNumbers);  // Output: [2, 4]

// Example of `reduce` (Aggregating values)
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
console.log(sum);  // Output: 15
```

### Example 4: Recursion

A recursive solution to calculate factorial:

```javascript
function factorial(n) {
    if (n === 0) {
        return 1;
    }
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

console.log(factorial(5));  // Output: 120
```

### Example 5: Immutability

Using `const` and non-mutating methods to ensure immutability:

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

// This does not change the original array
const newArr = arr.map(num => num * 2);
console.log(newArr);  // Output: [2, 4, 6]
console.log(arr);     // Output: [1, 2, 3] (unchanged)
```
