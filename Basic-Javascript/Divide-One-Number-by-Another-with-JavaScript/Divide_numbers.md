# Divide One Number by Another with JavaScript

We can also divide one number by another.

JavaScript uses the `/` symbol for division.

**Example**
```javascript
const myVar = 16 / 2;
```
`myVar` now has the value `8`.

Change the `0` so that the `quotient` is equal to `2`.

### Instructions:
1. The variable `quotient` should be equal to 2.
2. You should use the `/` operator.

## Before Output:
```javascript
const quotient = 66 / 0;
```

## After Output:
```javascript
const quotient = 66 / 33;
```
