# Basic JavaScript â€“ freeCodeCamp Solutions

JavaScript is a scripting language you can use to make web pages interactive. It is one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS, and is supported by all modern browsers.

In this course, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript. You'll start with basic data structures like numbers and strings. Then you'll learn to work with arrays, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more.

This folder contains my solutions for the **Basic JavaScript** section of the [freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/).

Each exercise includes:
- The **challenge title**
- My **solution code**
- The **output** (if any)
