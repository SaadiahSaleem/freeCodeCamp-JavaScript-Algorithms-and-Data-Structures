# Nest one Array within Another Array

You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like below:
```javascript
const teams = [["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]];
```

This is also called a _multi-dimensional array_.

Create a nested array called `myArray`.

### Instructions:
1. `myArray` should have at least one array nested within another array.

## Before Output:
```javascript
// Only change code below this line
const myArray = [];
```

## After Output:
```javascript
// Only change code below this line
const myArray = [["Apples", 10], ["Banana", 15]];
```
