# Compound Assignment With Augmented Division

The `/=` operator divides a variable by another number.

```javascript
myVar = myVar / 5;
```
Will divide `myVar` by `5`. This can be rewritten as:

```javascript
myVar /= 5;
```
Convert the assignments for `a`, `b`, and `c` to use the `/=` operator.

### Instructions:
1. `a` should equal `4`.
2. `b` should equal `27`.
3. `c` should equal `3`.
4. You should use the `/=` operator for each variable.
5. You should not modify the code above the specified comment.

## Before Output:
```javascript
let a = 48;
let b = 108;
let c = 33;

// Only change code below this line
a = a / 12;
b = b / 4;
c = c / 11;
```

## After Output:
```javascript
let a = 48;
let b = 108;
let c = 33;

// Only change code below this line
a /= 12;
b /= 4;
c /= 11;
```
