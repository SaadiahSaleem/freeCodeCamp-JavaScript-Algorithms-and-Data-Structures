# Write Reusable JavaScript with Functions

In JavaScript, we can divide up our code into reusable parts called _functions_.

Here's an example of a function:
```javascript
function functionName() {
  console.log("Hello World");
}
```

You can call or _invoke_ this function by using its name followed by parentheses, like this: `functionName();` Each time the function is called it will print out the message `Hello World` on the dev console. All of the code between the curly braces will be executed every time the function is called.

1. Create a function called `reusableFunction` which prints the string `Hi World` to the dev console.
2. Call the function.

### Instructions:
1. `reusableFunction` should be a function.
2. If `reusableFunction` is called, it should output the string `Hi World` to the console.
3. You should call `reusableFunction` once it is defined.

## Before Output:
```javascript

```

## After Output:
```javascript
function reusableFunction() {
  console.log("Hi World");
}

reusableFunction();
```
