# Passing Values to Functions with Arguments

_Parameters_ are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters. The actual values that are input (or "_passed_") into a function when it is called are known as _arguments_.

Here is a function with two parameters, `param1` and `param2`:

```javascript
function testFun(param1, param2) {
  console.log(param1, param2);
}
```

Then we can call `testFun` like this: `testFun("Hello", "World");`. We have passed two string arguments, `Hello` and `World`. Inside the function, `param1` will equal the string `Hello` and `param2` will equal the string `World`. Note that you could call `testFun` again with different arguments and the parameters would take on the value of the new arguments.

1. Create a function called `functionWithArgs` that accepts two arguments and outputs their sum to the dev console.
2. Call the function with two numbers as arguments.

### Instructions:
1. `functionWithArgs` should be a function.
2. `functionWithArgs(1,2)` should output `3`.
3. `functionWithArgs(7,9)` should output `16`.
4. You should call `functionWithArgs` with two numbers after you define it.

## Before Output:
```javascript

```

## After Output:
```javascript
function functionWithArgs(param1, param2) {
  console.log(param1 + param2);
}

functionWithArgs(1,2);
functionWithArgs(7,9);
```
