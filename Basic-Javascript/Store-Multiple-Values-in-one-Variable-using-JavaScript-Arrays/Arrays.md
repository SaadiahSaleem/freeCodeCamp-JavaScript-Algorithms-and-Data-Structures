# Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays

With JavaScript `array` variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:

```javascript
const sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"];
```

Modify the new array `myArray` so that it contains both a string and a number (in that order).

### Instructions:
1. `myArray` should be an array.
2. The first item in `myArray` should be a string.
3. The second item in `myArray` should be a number.


## Before Output:
```javascript
// Only change code below this line
const myArray = [];
```

## After Output:
```javascript
// Only change code below this line
const myArray = ["peanut butter",2];
```
