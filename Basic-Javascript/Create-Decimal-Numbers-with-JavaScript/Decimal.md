# Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScript

We can store decimal numbers in variables too. Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as *floating point* numbers or *floats*.

**Note:** when you compute numbers, they are computed with finite precision. Operations using floating points may lead to different results than the desired outcome. If you are getting one of these results, open a topic on the [freeCodeCamp forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/).

Create a variable `myDecimal` and give it a decimal value with a fractional part (e.g. `5.7`).

### Instructions:
1. `myDecimal` should be a number.
2. `myDecimal` should have a decimal point

## Before Output:
```javascript
const ourDecimal = 5.7;

// Only change code below this line

```

## After Output:
```javascript
const ourDecimal = 5.7;

// Only change code below this line
var myDecimal = 5.7;
```
