# Generate Random Whole Numbers within a Range

You can generate a random whole number in the range from zero to a given number. You can also pick a different lower number for this range.

You'll call your minimum number `min` and your maximum number `max`.

This formula gives a random whole number in the range from `min` to `max`. Take a moment to read it and try to understand what this code is doing:

```javascript
Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min
```
Create a function called `randomRange` that takes a range `myMin` and `myMax` and returns a random whole number that's greater than or equal to `myMin` and less than or equal to `myMax`.

### Instructions:
1. The lowest random number that can be generated by `randomRange` should be equal to your minimum number, `myMin`.
2. The highest random number that can be generated by `randomRange` should be equal to your maximum number, `myMax`.
3. The random number generated by `randomRange` should be an integer, not a decimal.
4. `randomRange` should use both `myMax` and `myMin`, and return a random number in your range.

## Before Output:
```javascript
function randomRange(myMin, myMax) {
  return 0;
}
```

## After Output:
```javascript
function randomRange(myMin, myMax) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (myMax - myMin + 1)) + myMin;
}

console.log(randomRange(3,9));
```
