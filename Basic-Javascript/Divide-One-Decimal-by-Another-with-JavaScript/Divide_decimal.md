# Divide One Decimal by Another with JavaScript

Now let's divide one decimal by another.

Change the `0.0` so that `quotient` will equal to `2.2`.

### Instructions:
1. The variable `quotient` should equal `2.2`
2. You should use the `/` operator to divide 4.4 by 2
3. The quotient variable should only be assigned once

## Before Output:
```javascript
const quotient = 0.0 / 2.0; // Change this line
```

## After Output:
```javascript
const quotient = 4.4 / 2.0; // Change this line
```
