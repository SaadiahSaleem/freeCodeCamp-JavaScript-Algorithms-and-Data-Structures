# Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication

The `*=` operator multiplies a variable by a number.

```javascript
myVar = myVar * 5;

```
will multiply `myVar` by `5`. This can be rewritten as:

```javascript
myVar *= 5;
```

Convert the assignments for `a`, `b`, and `c` to use the `*=` operator.

### Instructions:
1. `a` should equal `25`.
2. `b` should equal `36`.
3. `c` should equal `46`.
4. You should use the `*=` operator for each variable.
5. You should not modify the code above the specified comment.

## Before Output:
```javascript
let a = 5;
let b = 12;
let c = 4.6;

// Only change code below this line
a = a * 5;
b = 3 * b;
c = c * 10;
```

## After Output:
```javascript
let a = 5;
let b = 12;
let c = 4.6;

// Only change code below this line
a *= 5;
b *= 3;
c *= 10;
```
