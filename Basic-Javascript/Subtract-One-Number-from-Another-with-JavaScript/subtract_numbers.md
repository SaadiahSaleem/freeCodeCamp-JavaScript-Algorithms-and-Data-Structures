# Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript

We can also subtract one number from another.

JavaScript uses the `-` symbol for subtraction.

**Example**
```javascript
const myVar = 12 - 6;
```
`myVar` would have the value `6`.

Change the `0` so the difference is `12`.

### Instructions:
1. The variable `difference` should be equal to `12`.
2. You should only subtract one number from `45`.

## Before Output:
```javascript
const difference = 45 - 0;
```

## After Output:
```javascript
const difference = 45 - 33;
```
