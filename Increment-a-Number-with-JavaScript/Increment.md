# Increment a Number with JavaScript

You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the `++` operator.

```javascript
i++;
```
is the equivalent of

```javascript
i = i + 1;
```

**Note:** The entire line becomes `i++;`, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

Change the code to use the `++` operator on `myVar`.

### Instructions:
1. `myVar` should equal 88.
2. You should not use the assignment operator.
3. You should use the `++` operator.
4. You should not change code above the specified comment.

## Before Output:
```javascript
let myVar = 87;

// Only change code below this line
myVar = myVar + 1;
```

## After Output:
```javascript
let myVar = 87;

// Only change code below this line
myVar++;
```
